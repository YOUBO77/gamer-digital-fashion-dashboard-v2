While he's identified as Moroccan, his outfit and overall design don’t visually reflect Moroccan culture..there are no clear references to traditional Moroccan clothing like the jellaba or tarbouch. It feels like the game used Morocco more as a backdrop or exotic label without meaningfully representing our culture through his appearance ","6","6","7","Yes","7","Digital fashion has made me more aware of how clothing communicates identity and culture, both online and offline. In digital spaces, I feel that iu have the agency  to experiment with styles I wouldn't wear publicly due to social expectations in Morocco....tt the same time i have  started to notice how easily cultural elements are borrowed or misused in virtual outfits. It’s made me more conscious of the value and symbolism behind traditional garments like the djellaba or caftan  and how digital fashion can either honor or distort them"
